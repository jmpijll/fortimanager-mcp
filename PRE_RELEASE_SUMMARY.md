## Security Considerations

### Current Security Posture
- ✓ No credentials stored in code
- ✓ Token-based authentication recommended
- ✓ TLS/HTTPS support documented
- ✓ Security best practices documented
- ✓ .gitignore prevents credential commits
- ✓ Environment variables for configuration

### Security Recommendations for Users
1. Use API tokens instead of username/password
2. Enable SSL certificate verification in production
3. Rotate tokens regularly
4. Use least-privilege API accounts
5. Monitor API access logs
6. Test in isolated environments first
